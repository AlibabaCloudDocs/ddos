This feature is implemented based on the settings of IP addresses and ports for protected non-website business.

1.  Log on to the [Anti-DDoS Premium console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=ddosdip).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Provisioning** \> **Non-Website**.
3.  Select an Anti-DDoS Premium instance.
4.  Click **Edit** in the Session Persistence column corresponding to an existing forwarding rule. 

    **Note:** Session persistence is configured based on ports.

5.  In the **Session Persistence** dialog box that appears, set **Timeout**, and click **Confirm**. 

    **Note:** If you want to disable the session persistence feature, click **Disable Session Persistence**.
