# \[System upgrade\] Anti-DDoS Pro is upgraded on January 14 and 16, 2020

**Applicable services**: Anti-DDoS Pro

**Time**: \(UTC+8\) 00:00:00 to 06:00:00 on January 14 and 16, 2020

**Description**: The software of data centers where Anti-DDoS Pro is deployed is upgraded.

**Impact**: During the upgrade, connections to some IP addresses need to be reestablished. This breaks the TCP-based connections five times. Transient disconnection errors have little impact on services that use short-lived connections and persistent connections that can be automatically reestablished. Make sure that your services support automatic reconnection to ensure fault tolerance.

**Customer service**: We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you require any further assistance, we recommend that you contact [customer service](https://www.aliyun.com/contact?from=announcement).
