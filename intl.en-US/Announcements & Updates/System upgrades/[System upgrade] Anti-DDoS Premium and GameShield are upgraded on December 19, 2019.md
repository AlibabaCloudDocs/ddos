# \[System upgrade\] Anti-DDoS Premium and GameShield are upgraded on December 19, 2019

**Applicable services**: Anti-DDoS Premium and GameShield

**Time**: \(UTC+8\) 10:00:00 to 12:00:00 on December 19, 2019

**Description**: The software of data centers in Singapore where Anti-DDoS Premium and GameSheild are deployed is upgraded.

**Impact**: During the upgrade, connections to some IP addresses need to be reestablished. This breaks the TCP-based connections one to three times. Transient disconnection errors have little impact on services that use short-lived connections and persistent connections that can be automatically reestablished. Make sure that your services support automatic reconnection to ensure fault tolerance.

**Customer service**: We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you require any further assistance, we recommend that you contact [customer service](https://www.aliyun.com/contact?from=announcement).
