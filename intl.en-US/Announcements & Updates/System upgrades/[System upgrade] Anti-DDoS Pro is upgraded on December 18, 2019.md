# \[System upgrade\] Anti-DDoS Pro is upgraded on December 18, 2019

**Applicable services**: Anti-DDoS Pro

**Time**: \(UTC+8\) 00:00:00 to 06:00:00 on December 18, 2019

**Description**: The software of data centers where Anti-DDoS Pro is deployed is upgraded.

**Impact**: During the upgrade, your services are not affected. In some cases, the origin server is configured with strong security verification policies and the IP addresses need to be authenticated again. This breaks the TCP-based connections four to six times. Transient disconnection errors have little impact on services that use short-lived connections and persistent connections that can be automatically reestablished. Make sure that your services support automatic reconnection to ensure fault tolerance.

**Customer service**: We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you require any further assistance, we recommend that you contact [customer service](https://www.aliyun.com/contact?from=announcement).
