# \[System upgrade\] Anti-DDoS Premium is upgraded on April 23, 2020

**Applicable services**: Anti-DDoS Premium

**Time**: \(UTC+8\) 23:00:00 on April 23, 2020 to 03:00:00 on April 24, 2020

**Description**: The network of data centers where Anti-DDoS Premium is deployed is upgraded.

**Impact**: During the upgrade, connections to some IP addresses need to be reestablished. This breaks the TCP-based connections two to three times. Transient disconnection errors have little impact on services that use short-lived connections and persistent connections that can be automatically reestablished. Make sure that your services support automatic reconnection to ensure fault tolerance.

**Customer service**: We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you require any further assistance, we recommend that you contact [customer service](https://www.aliyun.com/contact?from=announcement).
