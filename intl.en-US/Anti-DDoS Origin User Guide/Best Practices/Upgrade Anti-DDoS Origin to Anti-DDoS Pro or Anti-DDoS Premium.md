# Upgrade Anti-DDoS Origin to Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium

This topic describes how to improve the protection capability by upgrading Anti-DDoS Origin to Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium. Given the design of Anti-DDoS Origin, the effect of protection may be compromised or the protection capability cannot meet your business requirements. In such cases, we recommend that you upgrade Anti-DDoS Origin to Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium.

For more information about the scenarios for which Anti-DDoS Origin is suitable, see [Scenarios](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction on Alibaba DDoS Protection/Anti-DDoS Origin/Scenarios.md).

If one of the following issues occurs when you use Anti-DDoS Origin, we recommend that you upgrade Anti-DDoS Origin to Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium:

-   DDoS attacks are volumetric and last for a long period of time.
-   HTTP flood attacks occur. However, Anti-DDoS Origin cannot mitigate these types of attacks.
-   Other specific issues.

**Note:** If you upgrade Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise to Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium, Alibaba Cloud refunds you for the remaining subscription of Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise.

If Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise, Anti-DDoS Pro, or Anti-DDoS Premium cannot meet your requirements, we recommend that you use the combination of Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise and Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium. For more information, see [Use Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise and Anti-DDoS Pro](/intl.en-US/Anti-DDoS Origin User Guide/Best Practices/Use Anti-DDoS Origin Enterprise and Anti-DDoS Pro.md).
