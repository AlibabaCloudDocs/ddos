# DescribePortViewSourceIsps

Queries the Internet service providers \(ISPs\) from which requests are sent to one or more Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium instances within a specific period of time.

**Note:** This operation cannot reflect the actual traffic volume because Layer 4 identity authentication algorithms are updated for Anti-DDoS Pro and Anti-DDoS Premium. You can call this operation to calculate only the proportion of requests sent from different ISPs. If you want to obtain the request traffic volume, we recommend that you call the [DescribePortFlowList](~~157460~~) operation.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=ddoscoo&api=DescribePortViewSourceIsps&type=RPC&version=2020-01-01)

## Request parameters
