# DescribePortFlowList

Queries the traffic data of one or more Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium instances.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=ddoscoo&api=DescribePortFlowList&type=RPC&version=2020-01-01)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|DescribePortFlowList|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to **DescribePortFlowList**. |
|EndTime|Long|Yes|1583683200|The end of the time range to query. This value is a UNIX timestamp representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the epoch time January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

 **Note:** This UNIX timestamp must indicate a time that is accurate to the minute. |
|InstanceIds.N|RepeatList|Yes|ddoscoo-cn-mp91j1ao\*\*\*\*|The ID of the instance.

 **Note:** You can call the [DescribeInstanceIds](~~157459~~) operation to query the IDs of all instances. |
|Interval|Integer|Yes|1000|The intervals for returning statistcs. Unit: seconds. |
|StartTime|Long|Yes|1582992000|The beginning of the time range to query. This value is a UNIX timestamp representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the epoch time January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

 **Note:** This UNIX timestamp must indicate a time that is accurate to the minute. |
|ResourceGroupId|String|No|default|The ID of the resource group to which the instance belongs in Resource Management. This parameter is empty by default, which indicates that the instance belongs to the default resource group. |
|RegionId|String|No|cn-hangzhou|The region ID of the instance. Valid values:

 -   **cn-hangzhou**: mainland China, which indicates an Anti-DDoS Pro instance
