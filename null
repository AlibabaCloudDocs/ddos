# Anti-DDoS Pro

Anti-DDoS Pro provides eight Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) lines at the Tbit/s level to protect your servers deployed in mainland China against DDoS attacks. Compared with anti-DDoS service based on Internet Data Centers \(IDCs\), Anti-DDoS Pro supports more stable networks with lower latency and quicker disaster recovery.

## Target users

Anti-DDoS Pro is suitable for workloads deployed in **mainland China**.

## Benefits

Anti-DDoS Pro provides the following benefits:

-   Highest BGP bandwidth in mainland China: Anti-DDoS Pro provides a maximum bandwidth of 1.5 Tbit/s to protect your services against DDoS attacks.
-   Top-quality bandwidth resources in mainland China: Anti-DDoS Pro provides BGP lines that cover most Internet service provider \(ISP\) networks in mainland China, such as China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, and China Education and Research Network. The average latency is approximately 20 milliseconds.
-   Distributed on-premises data centers to clean DDoS attacks: Anti-DDoS Pro provides more than eight on-premises data centers to scrub DDoS attacks. The total bandwidth exceeds 10 Tbit/s and the bandwidth of each on-premises data center exceeds 1 Tbit/s.
-   Only one IP address is required to access different ISP networks in mainland China and to meet the requirements of anti-DDoS protection.
-   Anti-DDoS Pro provides exclusive protection for more than 20 ISPs, such as China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, and China Education and Research Network.

## Scenarios

We recommend that you activate Anti-DDoS Pro if you have the following requirements:

-   Reliable networks that have a minimal latency, provide quick disaster recovery, and cover multiple ISP networks.
-   BGP lines that provide at least 20 Gbit/s bandwidth against basic DDoS attacks.
-   BGP lines that provide at least 300 Gbit/s bandwidth against DDoS attacks.
